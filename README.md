The web application is supposed to scrap the football websites to obtain information about the home form for the home team, 
away form for the away team and the head to head and player statistics. Predictions are also to be scrapped from the forebet 
website. However, even though the Application runs without errors, it doesn't show the required outputs. 
It shows no results found under all the outputs. I'll take time to research more about the possible cause of this.
